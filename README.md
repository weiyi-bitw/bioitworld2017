This repository contains data and scripts to run tutorials from the workshop.

## Setting up working environment

The easiest way to get started is to run the jupyter notebook from
[docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you do not have docker installed in your
environment, you can do so by following the instruction from the
docker website([Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows),
[Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)).

Once you have docker installed (you can run `docker run hello-world` without
error), you can build the docker image for this tutorial simply by doing

```
cd /path/to/where/you/clone/bioitworld2017
cd docker
docker build .
```

Once the image is built, you can run

```

```
